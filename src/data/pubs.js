    review: "A proper South London pub to kick things off. It opens at 11am, and we usually try and get in and out quickly to bank some breathing room later down the line. Lord Nelson is a common starting place for crawlers, so try and make friends with other groups if you see them there - you'll be seeing a lot of them throughout the day! Make sure you get a photo underneath the Old Kent Road sign. It's quite a distance to the next pub, and we enjoy taking Lime bikes across Tower Bridge while we can still function, but there are buses if this isn't an option.",

One of the few timber-framed buildings to survive the Great Fire of 1666, The Hoop and Grapes is steeped in history. With a similarly dimly-lit interior to the Minories, you can stand out the front if it's a nice day. If, like us, you are made fun of by locals for drinking halves, try not to feel too ashamed!

    review: "A charming little pub tucked away on a quiet street just off Bond Street. The Duke of York punches above its weight with a cosy, traditional interior. Definitely feels like a hidden gem. This is where the strict timings throughout the day pay dividends. If you've been careless, however, you'll be racing against the clock in order to finish the crawl.",

    review: "The grand finale. The Duchess is a sleek, modern venue just off Oxford Street - the perfect spot to celebrate the end of the epic Monopoly pub crawl. It closes at midnight, so you should be able to savour your conquest here. It is then up to you whether to celebrate the achievement and continue the night in one of Soho's many bars or clubs - I can say that we certainly haven't had the urge to carry on after completing the board. If you've made it to the end, you are part of the MonopElite - congratulations!",
